  <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>3 Eggs</li>
    <li>Slice of bacon (Optional)</li>
    <li>Hot dog sausage (Optional)</li>
    <li>Shredded Cheese (Optional but sad if you don't have it)</li>
    <li>Bowl</li>

  <h4>Step 1:
  Cut up the hot dog into slices and cook it alongside the bacon.</h4>
  <h4>Step 2:
  Prepare the eggs by cracking them into a bowl and whisking until mostly homogenous.</h4>
  <h4>Step 3:
  Set the bacon and sausage aside and dump the eggs into the pan. Tilt the pan so that the eggs are largely evenly spread over the pan</h4>
  <h4>Step 4:
  Top the eggs with the bacon, sausage and cheese to taste.</h4>
  <h4>Step 5:
    Once the eggs are solid, fold in into thirds. The great part about this step is that if you mess up, you can just pivot into scrambled eggs.</h4>
  <h4>Step 6:
    Plate and serve.</h4>
